# Project 1: The Game (tic tac toe)

My first project with General Assembly as part of Software Engineering Immersive with the following deliverables:

- Render a game in the browser
- Switch turns between more than one player
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

And some extra features!
