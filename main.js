// Breakdown of the logic to be implemented for the game of tic tac toe

// 1. An input (play) for each of the two players is required and is to fill up one space on the board
// 2. After an input (play), check if any one row OR column OR diagonal has been filled by one of the players
// 3. If any one row OR column OR diagonal has been filled by a player, pause the game and display a message indicating the victory
// 4. If no row, column, and diagonal has been filled by one player, initiate the next player's turn
// 5. If there are no spaces left on the board (i.e all spaces have been filled by players' inputs), declare DRAW
// 6. Declare a counter variable that increments with each game played to let users know how many games have been played.
// 7. Declare a counter variable for each player that increments with their winnings respectively.
// 8. When the game ends, prompt the user if they would like to play again -> if YES, reset the board.
